# Circular - A Houdini Layout

 [The Layout API](https://dev.to/adrianbdesigns/css-houdini-s-layout-api-explained-33pa) allows developers to extend the browserâ€™s layout rendering process by defining new layout modes that can be used in display CSS property. 

 `Circular` uses the API to create a layout that evenly places elements along a circle path. 

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd houdini-challenge
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
